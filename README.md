### Using with Google Sites

### A. Embed a File Card

1. Copy a File Card's `IFrame Embed URL`.
2. Paste the `IFrame Embed URL` in Google Site's **Embed from the web** - By URL input prompt.
3. Preview or Publish the Google Site draft page.

Google Sites Sample Web page:<br>

### B. Embed a Full Page Containing a Group of File Cards

1. Copy a File Card's `Cards Gallery URL`.
2. Create a **Full page embed** Google Site draft page.
3. Press the **Add embed** button in the resulting blank page and paste the `Cards Gallery URL` in the **Embed from the web** - By URL input prompt.
   - This page will display all File Cards with similar `"category"` field value like the current Card.
4. Preview or Publish the Google Site draft page.

## Requirements

1. Windows, Linux or Mac OS
2. NodeJS LTS v16.14.2
3. Firebase Project

### Core Libraries/Frameworks

1. **NextJS v13.0.4** (client-side SSG)
   - NextJS is one of the @latest React frameworks officially endorsed on the react.dev website
   - NextJS's Static Side Generation (SSG) feature, combined with Incremental Static Generation (ISG) creates SEO-optimized websites fit for uploading on static hosting services such as GitHub Pages.
   - NextJS offers code automatic code-splitting, enabling a smaller download footprint per page route
2. **React 18.2.0**
   - React version 18's is the latest react version as of this writing
3. **@reduxjs/toolkit v1.9.3**
   - Redux offers a structured, organized, and centralized global "state management" system as a single source of truth that occasionally syncs with the database.
   - Redux states are available across all components using intuitively-named hooks.
   - Redux states are more predictable, consistent and less prone to errors by
     - promoting data normalization (which is optional), and
     - use of reducers which ensures data immutability
   - Its async data fetching mechanisms and middleware sync well with complex store states and of informing the client app of the loading state.
   - Redux states are easy to debug using the Redux Dev tools.
   - People can easily follow where the centralized data stores and async data fetching methods are located in the code base when working in teams, especially for large, complex enterprise apps.
   - Redux state management will scale well with this app's incoming feature updates containing more complex data models and states.
   - Redux has excellent documentation and a thriving community, and it has proven to be one of the most mature, albeit boilerplates and complex react state management libraries of all time.
4. **firebase v9.18.0**
   - Firebase, being a Backend-as-a-Service (Baas), makes it possible to create apps without creating a separate backend server app.
     - Firebase offers a Web (JavaScript) SDK for working on the frontend (websites) and the Firebase Admin SDK for client-side scripting.
   - Firebase offers ready to use Authentication systems
   - Firestore database provides a lightweight document database for storing and querying simple data. Security is enforced using the Firebase Security Rules.
   - Firebase Storage provides an easy-to-use and access container for rich-data content. Security is enforced using the Firebase Storage Security Rules.
   - Firebase offers generous limits for testing and playing around with its Spark (standard) plan, after which users can upgrade to the Blaze (paid) Plan as needed.
5. **firebase-admin v11.5.0**
   - The Firebase Admin SDK allows elevated scripting access to various Firebase services, that are not available when using the Firebase (JavaScript) SDK.

   ```
   # Install client dependencies
   cd client
   npm install

   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the README files inside the **/client** and **/server** directories for more information on configuring and using the client and server apps.

3. Create an account after setting up the **/server** `.env` using the instructions in its README file.<br>
   - Navigate to the /server directory from the command line and run:<br>
`npm run user:create --email=randomemail@gmail.com --password=anypasasword --displayname="Game Tester" --emailverified=true`

## Run with Docker

### Build Images Locally

1. Build the images locally, then run.
2. Follow the instructions under the [Installation](#installation) section for more information after spinning up a container.

   ```
   # Run on development mode
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml build
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down

   # Build and run for production mode
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down

### Using the Pre-Built Docker Images

This project deploys the latest **client** and **server** development Docker images to Docker Hub on the creation of new Release/Tags. They are available at:<br>

https://hub.docker.com/r/weaponsforge/gsites-components

1. Pull the pre-built development Docker images using any of the two (2) options:
   - Open a terminal and run:<br>
      ```
      docker pull weaponsforge/gsites-components:client
      docker pull weaponsforge/gsites-components:server
      ```
